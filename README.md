## website description <a name = "website-description"></a>

- The Coach Finder App has two features.
  - It has the find a coach feature.
  - It has a feature to send requests messages.
- For the find a coach part:
  - We want to be able to list all available coaches, So all the coaches that signed up with our application.
  - We want to be able to view the coach details.
  - We will be able to register as a coach, and we'll be able to contact a coach.
  - The contact a coach feature also establishes the connection to the other part of this web  app.

- For the the requests part:
  - We will be able to send such requests to coaches.
  - And as a coach, we can view incoming requests so that we then potentially can reply to them.
